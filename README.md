Master’s Thesis (Quantum Sensing Technology, Spin Microscopy Lab)

• Conducted research on the enhancement of low magnetic field sensing using a Nitrogen-vacancy center
in diamond through high-resolution spectroscopy.

• Analyzed the impact of microwave polarization on the transition strength of NV center spin states.

• Derived the analytical expression for transition imbalance as a function of microwave polarization,
providing deeper insights into the behavior of the NV center at zero magnetic field.

• Performed controlled spin state transitions using a combination of microwave and RF fields.

• Developed a novel method for vector magnetometry using MW polarization.
